This is the code for the numerical example of *Tracking problem*

To generate data, train with MSE, and train with TS
```bash
bash examples/Eg2/E2_run.sh
```
Data can also be downloaded from huggingface 


To determine kernel variance, run 
```bash
python examples/Eg2/code/E2_ker.py
```

To show the numerical results, run examples/Eg2/show/E2_show_all.ipynb
