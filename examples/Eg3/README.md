This is the code for the numerical example of *MEP calculation*

To generate data, train with MSE, and train with TS
```bash
bash examples/Eg3/E3_run.sh
```
Data can also be downloaded from huggingface 

To determine kernel variance, run 
```bash
python examples/Eg3/code/E3_ker.py
```

To show the numerical results, run examples/Eg3/show/E3_show.ipynb
